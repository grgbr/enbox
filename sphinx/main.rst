Overview
========

Enbox_'s primary goal is to secure processes running onto Linux based systems.

Simply put, Enbox_ provides a way to run a Linux process in an isolated runtime
environment which we call a |jail|. This runtime container confers the ability
to control the process accesses to system resources according to a predefined
configuration.

Thanks to Enbox_, a process gains additional security since isolated from all
other processes on the |host| machine. In addition, the whole system is
hardened against software vulnerabilities since processes may be run with
restricted privileges.

Enbox_ ships with a **library**, a **binary tool** as well as a PAM_ **session
module**.
See section Usage_ for more informations.

.. _sect-main-terminology:

Terminology
===========

Using Enbox_ involves setting up multiple kind of objects. These are described
in the following sections.

.. _sect-main-jail:

Jail
----

A runtime container from within which a process runs isolated from all other
processes on the |host| machine. Once all jail'ed (possibly child) processes
have |exit(3)|'ed, the container is destroyed and all its allocated resources
are released by the kernel.

Enbox_ allows you to control how isolated a jail is from global system
resources, other processes and jails on the |host| machine. The underlying
containment logic is based upon Linux's |namespaces|, |capabilities| and
|credentials| switching mechanisms.

Depending on the jail'ed process expectations, the jail may require |host| and
/ or jail filesystem images to properly run. Enbox_ allows you to define and
populate both |host| and jail'ed filesystem hierarchies.

You may think of a |jail| as an extended version of |chroot(8)| with additional
isolation not available when simply using it. In addition, Enbox_ ease
the process of preparing the |chroot(8)| filesystem image by combining 2 Linux
kernel features:

* |mount_namespaces(7)|
* and |bind mount|.

|host| side filesystem hierarchies may be imported into jail using the |bind
mount| machinery. These mounts are performed from within the jail's own mount
namespace (see |mount_namespaces(7)|) and are implitcly released once the jail
dies.

.. _sect-main-host:

Host
----

The hardware machine the initial OS is running on.
Thanks to Linux OS services, Enbox_ allows you to define and dedicate subsets of
|host| resources to be shared with a |jail|.

Depending on |jail|'s expectations, you may need to populate the host filesystem
with entries that may later be imported into the |jail|. This is also the
mechanisms used to share filesystem content between the host and a |jail|.

These filesystem entries are persistent from the |jail|'s point of view, i.e
removal of entries is delegated to system administration tasks.

.. _sect-main-credentials:

Credentials
-----------

A set of identifiers described into section `User and group identifiers` of
|credentials(7)|, namely:

* |uid|,
* |gid|,
* |supplementary groups|.

When switching to a pre-configured set of identifiers, Enbox_ drops inherited
privileges of current process.

When combined with |capabilities| management, this mechanism allows Enbox_ to
enforce permanent strong privilege restrictions.

.. _sect-main-capabilities:

Capabilities
------------

Privilege restriction relies upon the Linux capability mechanism. As stated
into |capabilities(7)|:

    [...] Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser
    into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently
    enabled and disabled.

Enbox_ ensures that all capabilities are dropped when switching to a
non-privileged user (using |setresuid(2)|) and at |execve(2)| time.

.. _sect-main-namespaces:

Namespaces
----------

The container logic implementation is based upon Linux's namespaces. As stated
into |namespaces(7)|:

    A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes
    it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own
    isolated instance of the global resource. Changes to the global resource
    are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but
    are invisible to other processes.

More specifically, Enbox_ handles the following types of namespace:

* |mount_namespaces(7)|,
* |cgroup_namespaces(7)|,
* `UTS` namespaces (see |namespaces(7)|),
* `IPC` namespaces (see |namespaces(7)|),
* and |network_namespaces(7)|.

Enbox_ is mainly designed to run onto embedded systems, i.e., from within a
controlled software runtime. That is the reason why Enbox_ is a |execve(2)| based
containment system only (to keep things simple and lightweight). As a
consequence, this comes with a few limitations with respect to namespace
isolation handling:

* |pid_namespaces(7)| are not supported since we don't want to handle fork /
  init process machinery ; instead, we may rely upon secure |procfs(5)|
  operations to provide some sort of |pid| space isolation (see |procfs(5)|
  hidepid / gid / subset mount options) ;
* |user_namespaces(7)| are not supported either since we don't really need it
  for now (we have no use case for emulating a complete virtualized OS while
  running onto an embedded system).

.. _sect-main-audit:

Audit
-----

Audit event or log can be attach to a unique Linux kernel audit identifier
called `auid`. This identifier, stored into the :file:`/proc/self/loginuid`,
may also be set by a call to |audit_setloginuid(3)|.

The Linux kernel interprets the `auid` as a 32-bits long integer with the
special value ``4294967295`` (or ``-1`` as a 32-bits signed integer) meaning the
identifier is `unset`.

See `Linux kernel loginuid documentation`_ for more informations.

Features
========

* optional process isolation thanks to |namespaces|
* optional privileges restriction  thanks to |capabilities| and |credentials|
* manage filesystem objects
* |execve(2)| based, i.e., no |fork(2)| support
* no |pid| space isolation although |procfs(5)| based restriction may apply
* no |uid| / |gid| space isolation
* lightweight
* Linux OS only

.. _sect-main-usage:

Usage
=====

Enbox_ comes with the :program:`enbox` tool to allow system administrators to
setup and instantiate processes according to settings stored into dedicated
|configuration| files.
Refer to :doc:`/man/enbox` manual page for more informations.

In addition, a PAM_ **session module** is provided to allow system
administrators to setup and instantiate containers and / or processes from
within a PAM_ stack according to settings stored into a specified
|configuration| file.
Refer to :doc:`/man/pam_enbox` manual page to for more informations.

Finally, the :ref:`Enbox library <sect-api-overview>`, which the
:program:`enbox` tool is based upon, provides developpers with a way to carry
out Enbox_ related tasks directly from their own code.

.. _sect-main-configuration:

Configuration
=============

Configuration is stored in an ASCII text file that contains a structured and
hierarchical sequence of statements parsed using the `libconfig library`_.

Conventions
-----------

The file may contain extra *spaces*, *tabulations* and *newlines* for formatting
purposes. Keywords are *case-sensitive*.
*Comments* may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).
Comments begin with the ``#`` character and end at the end of the line.

Configuration file grammar is inspired by the `utility conventions`_ defined
into the `IEEE Std 1003.1`_ POSIX specification:

* literals are enclosed within single quotes, i.e. ``'`` ;
* expressions surrounded by angle brackets, i.e. ``<`` and ``>``, require
  substitution ;
* expressions enclosed within brackets, i.e. ``[`` and ``]``, are optional ;
* expressions separated by a vertical line, i.e. ``|``, are mutually exclusive ;
* when followed by ellipses, i.e. ``...``, one or more occurrences of an
  expression are allowed ;
* expressions enclosed within parentheses, i.e. ``(`` and ``)``, are grouped
  together.

.. _libconfig-types:

.. topic:: Elementary types

   The following predefined non-terminal production rules are used throughout
   this document and refer to the corresponding `libconfig library`_ types.
   Please head to the `libconfig manual`_ to refer to related definitions. These
   are:

   * the *boolean* type <`BOOL <libconfig-bool_>`_>,
   * the *integer* type <`INT <libconfig-int_>`_>,
   * the *string* type <`STRING <libconfig-string_>`_>.

      <**SSEP**> ::= ';' [<**LF**>]... | <**LF**>... *; group setting separator*

Grammar
-------

Configuration essentially consists of a list of statements. It shall start with
at least one of the top-level statements according to the following syntax.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**config**>    ::= <**host-conf**> | <**cmd-conf**> | <**pam-conf**>
   <**host-conf**> ::= <`top-host`_>
   <**cmd-conf**>  ::= [<`top-host`_>] [<`top-ids`_>] [<`top-jail`_>] [`top-proc`_] <`top-cmd`_>
   <**pam-conf**>  ::= [<`top-host`_>] [<`top-ids`_>] [<`top-jail`_>] <`top-proc`_>

**host-conf** and **cmd-conf** syntax rules apply to a configuration loaded by
the :doc:`Enbox tool </man/enbox>`, whereas **pam-conf** applies to a
configuration loaded from within the :doc:`Enbox PAM module </man/pam_enbox>`.

Each top-level statement configures a subset of the Enbox_ behavior as described
below:

* `top-host`_ statement relates to host filesystem content ;
* `top-ids`_ statement relates to process and jail |credentials| ;
* `top-jail`_ statement relates to containment logic ;
* `top-proc`_ statement relates to process logic ;
* `top-cmd`_ statement relates to program execution.
  
.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Populate the host filesystem
   host = (
        ...
   )

   # Credentials settings
   ids = {
        ...
   }

   # Containment logic settings
   jail = {
        ...
   }

   # Process settings
   proc = {
        ...
   }

   # Command settings
   cmd = [ ... ]

Important notes
---------------

Enbox_ being an |execve(2)| based containment system only, it is sometimes
required to perform minor cleanup operations at post |execve(2)| time.

Capabilities cleanup
********************

When a containerized process is required to run with system |capabilities|
(configured thanks to a top-jail_ / caps-attr_ statements), it may be desirable
to cleanup |capabilities| from the *inheritable* and *ambient* sets after Enbox_
calls |execve(2)| to prevent from leaking runtime security context informations.

In this case, Enbox_ provides a small post-processing library called
:file:`libenbox_postproc.so` that may be |bind mount|'ed within the |jail| to
perform the cleanup of |capabilities| at loading time.
This library may be run thanks to the ability of the |ld.so(8)| system dynamic
loader to preload arbitrary shared objects before jumping to the ``main()``
entry point of the binary given as |execve(2)| argument (configured thanks to
the top-cmd_ statement).

The :file:`libenbox_postproc.so` library allows callers of the |execve(2)|
syscall to enable inherited / ambient capabilities cleanup for a fixed number of
times specified thanks to the special ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` |environment|
variable.
When existing, the ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` |environment| variable should hold a
*positive integer* that the library decrements each time it is run, i.e., each
time the current process performs an |execve(2)|.
Once the ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` |environment| variable value reaches zero, the
variable is removed from the |environment| and the inherited capabilitiy cleanup
logic is re-enabled again and applied.

The |capabilities| cleanup logic is implemented as following:

* runs after calls to |execve(2)| thanks to |ld.so(8)| preloading mechanism ;
* cleanup inherited / ambient |capabilities| *AND* remove
  ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` from |environment| when *one* of the following
  conditions are met:

  * current process runs in non-privileged mode, i.e., its effective user /
    group IDs differ from its real user / group IDs ;
  * ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` is *undefined* ;
  * ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` is *empty* ;
  * ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` value is ``0`` ;

* otherwise, decrement the value of ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` by ``1``.

The 2 *recommended* ways to preload the ``libenbox_postproc.so`` library to
perform a cleanup of |capabilities| are described in the following sections.

.. note::

   A third alternative, based upon usage of the ``LD_PRELOAD`` |environment|
   variable, is not discussed here since its content would be required to be
   cleared from any references to the ``libenbox_postproc.so`` library at some
   point in time (and it is not implemented).

ld.so.preload strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This logic is based upon the ability of the |ld.so(8)| dynamic loader to preload
libraries declared into the :file:`ld.so.preload` text file located under the
|SYSCONFDIR| directory setup at C library build / install time.

You *must* opt for this strategy when the processes |execve(2)| call tree
requires a |capabilities| cleanup at depth ``>= 1``, i.e., when the initial
value of ``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` |environment| variable is ``>= 1``.
Section `OpenSSH server`_ below describes such a context where grand-children
processes require |capabilities| cleanup operations.

                           flags  = [ "ro", "nodev", "nosuid", "noatime", "noexec" ]
                   },
                   { # Import system dynamic loader into jail.
                           type   = "file"
                           path   = "lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2"
                           orig   = "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2"
                           flags  = [ "ro", "nodev", "nosuid", "noatime" ]
                   },

                           flags  = [ "ro", "nodev", "nosuid", "noatime" ]
                   },

                   ...
           )
   }

   # Define our daemon process properties.
   proc = {
        ...

        # Tell the Enbox post execve(2) processing library that inherited /
        # ambient capability cleanup happens just after a grand-child of our
        # daemon process calls execve(2).
        env   = [ "ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS=2" ]

        # Our daemon process and its direct children run with
        # CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE and CAP_NET_RAW # capabilities enabled.
        caps  = [ "net_bind_service", "net_raw" ]

        ...
   }

   # Define the command to execve(2) used to run our daemon. Thanks to the
   # `ld.so.preload' file installed above, ld.so(8) will preload Enbox's
   # `libenbox_postproc.so' post execve(2) processing library so that it
   # executes before our daemon's `main()' entry point.
   cmd = [ "/sbin/mydaemon", "an_argument" ]

For this logic to properly work, it is required to import a
:file:`ld.so.preload` file as shown at line *16* of the above example. As stated
into the |ld.so(8)| manual page, this file should contain a whitespace-separated
list of ELF shared objects to be loaded before the |execve(2)|'ed program.
You *must* declare :file:`libenbox_postproc.so` entry in this file as shown
below:

.. code-block::

   libenbox_postproc.so

Note that Enbox_ comes with a prebuilt :file:`ld.so.preload` file installed
under the *|DATADIR|/enbox* directory. This is the one used in the configuration
example shown above.

This strategy is the most versatile one but note that the
:file:`libenbox_postproc.so` library will run each time a process calls
|execve(2)|, which may be suboptimal in some cases. This may happen, for
example, when a single containerized process calling |execve(2)| does
require no |capabilities| cleanup.
See the section below for more informations about an optimal alternate
configuration strategy.

ld.so --preload strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This logic is based upon the ability of the |ld.so(8)| dynamic loader to preload
libraries declared into its own command line thanks to the :option:`--preload`
option. |ld.so(8)| will filter out the option from the final program command
line given to |execve(2)|.

You *should* opt for this strategy when the processes |execve(2)| call tree
requires a |capabilities| cleanup at first depth only, i.e., when the
``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` |environment| variable is *undefined*, *empty* or when
its initial value equals to *zero*.

                   { # Import Enbox post execve(2) processing library into jail.
                           type   = "file"
                           path   = "lib/libenbox_postproc.so"
                           orig   = "/lib/libenbox_postproc.so"

                           flags  = [ "ro", "nodev", "nosuid", "noatime" ]
                   },

        caps  = [ "net_bind_service", "net_raw" ]

        ...
   }

   # Define the command to execve(2) used to run our daemon. Note how ld.so(8)
   # is given the `--preload' option to enforce the preload of Enbox's

   # executes before our daemon's `main()' entry point.
   cmd = [ "/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2", "--preload", "libenbox_postproc.so",
           "/sbin/mydaemon", "an_argument" ]


Contrary to the strategy explained into `ld.so.preload strategy`_ section above,
no :file:`ld.so.preload` file import into the jail is required here. In
addition, as no |capabilities| cleanup is expected for process descendants, no
``ENBOX_KEEP_INH_CAPS`` |environment| variable needs to be defined since the
cleanup operation happens implicitly at ``libenbox_postproc.so`` library
(pre)loading time in this case.

.. important::
   For obvisous security reasons, the propagation of ``CAP_SETPCAP`` and
   ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` capabilities are rejected.

.. warning::
   It is an *error* to specify this statement within a configuration loaded from
   the :doc:`Enbox PAM module </man/pam_enbox>`.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

This statement must be a array of *comma-separated strings* where each item
defines an |environment| variable. As shown above, 2 different kinds of
definition may coexist:

* the <**inherit-var**> form defines a variable which value should
  be *inherited* from the existing |environment| ;
* the <**set-var**> form defines a variable which should be assigned an
  *optional explicit value*, i.e. which may be empty.

This attribute is *optional*. By *default*, the |environment| is *cleared*
before running the command process.

fs-path-attr
************

Define a filesystem entry |pathname|.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**fs-path-attr**> ::= 'path = "' <|pathname|> '"'

.. important::

   When used to define a |jail| filesystem entry (thanks to a jail-fsset_
   statement), |pathname| **MUST** be specified as relative to |jail|'s root
   directory, i.e. with no leading ``/``.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   ...
   path = "/mypath"
   ...

fs-proc
*******

Define a |procfs(5)| filesystem entry to be mounted from within a |jail|.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**fs-proc**> ::= 'type = "proc"'
                 [|SSEP| <`fs-proc-flags`_>]
                 [|SSEP| <`fs-bind-opts`_>]

Mount a |procfs(5)| filesystem under the :file:`/proc` mount point into the
|jail|.

.. important::

   Enbox_ implicitly creates the :file:`/proc` mount point directory into the
   |jail|.

Use fs-proc-flags_ and fs-bind-opts_ to customize the way the :file:`/proc` is
made visible from inside the |jail|.

The fs-proc-flags_ attribute is *optional*. See fs-proc-flags_ statement for
more informations about default flags.

The fs-bind-opts_ attribute is *optional* and defaults to the |STRING|
``hidepid=invisible,subset=pid`` when unspecified.

.. rubric:: Example

                         [|SSEP| <`group-attr`_>]
   <**fs-slink-target**> ::= 'target = "' <|pathname|> '"'


Use fs-path-attr_ to specify the pathname of symbolic the link to create.¬†Use
**fs-slink-target** attribute to specify the target |pathname| the symbolic link
points to.

Attributes mentioned above are *mandatory*.

You may specify the symbolic link owner thanks to user-attr_. This
attribute is optional and *defaults* to the current |effective user| when
unspecified.

You may also specify the symbolic link group membership thanks to group-attr_.
This attribute is optional and *defaults* to the current |effective group| when
unspecified.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Define a symbolic link
   {
           type   = "slink"
           # Symbolic link pathname
           path   = "/tmp/mylink"
           # Symbolic link target pathname pointing to /tmp/mytarget...
           target = "mytarget"
   }

fs-tree
*******

Make a |host| filesystem (sub)tree visible from within a |jail|.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::

                 [|SSEP| <`fs-bind-opts`_>]

The specified (sub)tree is |bind mount|'ed into the |jail|.

Use fs-orig-attr_ to specify the |pathname| identifying the (sub)tree onto the
|host|.  Use fs-path-attr_ to specify a |pathname| *relative* to the |jail|'s
root directory that identifies the (sub)tree mount point directory within the
|jail|.

.. important::

   Enbox_ implicitly creates |jail|'s (sub)tree mount point when needed.

Attributes mentioned above are *mandatory*.

Use fs-tree-flags_ and fs-bind-opts_ to customize the way the (sub)tree is made
visible from inside the |jail|. These attributes are optional and *defaults* to
none when unspecified.

.. rubric:: Example

                      | 'strictatime'
                      | 'nodiratime'

Setup common *per-mount-point* flags when making a |host| filesystem entry
visible from within a |jail| using fs-tree_ statement.

Flags are given as an array of |STRING| and are documented in section `Mount
flags`_.
This attribute is optional and *defaults* to none when unspecified, meaning that
original host side (sub)tree's filesystem mounting flags apply.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 11,12,13,14

group-attr
**********

Assign specified group membership to the related parent object.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**group-attr**> ::= 'group =' <**group**>
   <**group**>      ::= <|gid|> | '"' <|groupname|> '"'

Setup group specified by <**group**> statement to permissions of a parent
filesystem object. See sections `jail-fsset`_ and `top-host`_ for more
informations about concerned filesystem object types.

As shown above, <**group**> may be specified as either a |gid| or a |groupname|.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 7,8

   # Define a loopback block device file

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**jail-fsset**> ::= 'fsset = (' <**jail-fsent**> [|LSEP| <**jail-fsent**>]... ')'
   <**jail-fsent**> ::= '{' <`fs-file`_> | <`fs-dir`_> | <`fs-slink`_> | <`fs-tree`_> | <`fs-proc`_> '}'

`jail-fsset`_ is *optional*. If not defined, the |jail|'s root filesystem is
mounted empty at *process* configuration time.

|jail|'s filesystem entries are created according to a list of <**jail-fsent**>
statements. Entry definitions must be provided in order so that all leading path
components exist at creation time.

Created entries will be available at *command* execution time (see the
`top-cmd`_ statement). Created entries are implicitly destroyed when the |jail|
dies.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 3-20

   jail = {
           ...
           # Populate the jail filesystem
           fsset = (

                   },
                   ...
           )
   }

.. _sect-main-ns_attr:

ns-attr
*******

Specify an optional list of |namespaces| to make a |jail| a member of.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**ns-attr**> ::= 'namespaces = [' <**ns-list**> ']'
   <**ns-list**> ::= '"' <**ns**> '"' [|LSEP| '"' <**ns**> '"']...
   <**ns**>      ::= 'mount'

               | 'uts'
               | 'ipc'
               | 'net'

For each type of namespace specified in the <**ns-list**> statement, Enbox_
creates a new namespace of the given type and makes the |jail| a member of it.

|Namespaces| are given as an array of |STRING|. `ns-attr`_ is *optional* and
defaults to the |STRING| array ``[ "mount", "cgroup", "uts", "ipc", "net" ]``
when unspecified.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5

   # Define a jail
   jail = {
           ...
           # Namespaces the jail is a member of
           namespaces = [ "mount", "uts", "ipc", "net" ]
           ...
   }

.. _sect-main-top_cmd:

top-cmd
********

Specify the command program and arguments to |execve(2)|.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**top-cmd**> ::= 'cmd = [' <|pathname|> [|LSEP| <cmd-arg> ]... ']'
   <**cmd-arg**> ::= '"' |STRING| '"'

This attribute is *optional*, in which case `top-ids`_, `top-jail`_ and
`top-proc`_ statements are *ignored*. However, specifying a `top-cmd`_
*requires* a valid `top-proc`_ statement.

.. warning::
   It is an *error* to specify this statement within a configuration loaded from
   the :doc:`Enbox PAM module </man/pam_enbox>`.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Command / program to execve(2)
   cmd = [ "/sbin/mydaemon", "--opt", "value" ]

.. _sect-main-top_host:

top-host
********

Define a list of entries to create onto the |host| filesystem. This is usefull
when it needs to be dynamically populated at runtime prior to running a command
specified by `top-cmd`_.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**top-host**>   ::= 'host = (' <**host-fsent**> [|LSEP| <**host-fsent**>]... ')'
   <**host-fsent**> ::= '{' <`fs-dir`_> | <`fs-slink`_> | <`fs-chrdev`_> | <`fs-blkdev`_> | <`fs-fifo`_> '}'

If not existing, defined entries will be created. Otherwise, existing entry will
be modified according to specified attributes where possible.
Entry definitions must be provided in order so that all leading path components
exist at creation time.

Created entries may be further *imported* into the jail via the `top-jail`_
statement. They will will be available at *command* execution time (see the
`top-cmd`_ statement).

Note that this statement is *optional* except when no `top-cmd`_ statement is
specified where it is *mandatory*.

Note that Enbox_ does not handle the removal of created entries. It is delegated
to system administration tasks.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Populate the host filesystem
   host = (
           { # Create a /tmp/mydir directory entry.
                   path = "/tmp/mydir"
                   type = "dir"
                   mode = 0755
           },
           { # Create a /tmp/mydir/fifo named pipe entry
                   path = "/tmp/mydir/fifo"
                   type = "fifo"
                   mode = 0644
           }
   )

top-ids
*******

From within a `top-proc`_ statement, define system user and groups used to
change current process user / group |credentials|.

This setting is *optional*. If not defined, no user / group IDs change will
happen before running the command specified by a `top-cmd`_ statement, i.e., it
will run using the current process user / group |credentials|.
In addition, this statement is ignored when no `top-cmd`_ is specified.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**top-ids**> ::= 'ids = {' <`user-attr`_> [|SSEP| <`drop-supp-attr`_>] '}'

Use `user-attr`_ to specify the system user to load |credentials| for.

Setup `drop-supp-attr`_ to specify how to load |supplementary groups| the
user specified by `user-attr`_ is a member of.

Note that group access list will always contain the user's primary group.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Load system user and groups
   ids = {
           # System user and its (implicit) related primary group
           user = "myuser"
           # Do drop supplementary groups myuser is a member of.
           drop_supp = true
   }

.. _sect-main-top_jail:

top-jail
********

Specify an optional |jail| to spawn with tunable settings.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**top-jail**>   ::= 'jail = {' [<**jail-attr**> [|SSEP| <**jail-attr**>]... '}'
   <**jail-attr**>  ::= <`ns-attr`_> | <`fs-path-attr`_> | <`jail-fsset`_>

`top-jail`_ is *optional*. If not defined, no jail will be spawned at process
configuration time and therefore, before running a command specified by a
`top-cmd`_ statement.
Specifying a `top-jail`_ *requires* a valid `top-proc`_ statement so that a
the |jail| may be spawned according to `top-proc`_ statement.
In addition, this statement is ignored when no `top-cmd`_ is specified.

Also note that the |jail| build logic assigns its root filesystem entries group
membership according to the `top-ids`_ statement when specified from
within the `top-proc`_ statement.
When unspecified, current process primary group membership is assigned instead
(see |credentials| for more informations).

Use `ns-attr`_ to specify which |namespaces| to make the |jail| a member of.
Use `fs-path-attr`_ to specify the |pathname| to the |jail|'s filesystem root
directory.
Use <`jail-fsset`_> to instruct Enbox_ how to populate the |jail|'s filesystem
content.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   jail = {
           # Namespaces the jail is a member of
           namespaces = [ "mount", "cgroup", "uts", "ipc", "net" ]
           # Pathname to jail's filesystem root directory
           path       = "/tmp/jail"
           # Populate the jail filesystem
           fsset      = (
                   ...
           )
   }

.. _sect-main-top_proc:

top-proc
********

Specify current process system runtime properties.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::

   <**proc-cwd**>   ::= [|SSEP| <`cwd-attr`_>]
   <**proc-fds**>   ::= [|SSEP| <`fds-attr`_>]

`top-proc`_ is *mandatory* when a `top-cmd`_ statement is specified. It is
*ignored* otherwise.

Use `env-attr`_ to specify the |environment| to run the command process with.
Use `umask-attr`_ to specify the |umask| to run the command process with.
Use `auid-attr`_ to specify the |audit| identifier to run the command process with.
Use `caps-attr`_ to specify the |capabilities| to run the command process with.
Use `cwd-attr`_ to specify the |cwd| to run the command process with.
Use `fds-attr`_ to specify the which unwanted file descriptors to close.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Specify a command to run
   proc = {
           # Command process's environment variables
           env = [ "USER",
                   "HOME",
                   "MYBOOLVAR=",
                   "MYSTRINGVAR=a string value" ]
           # Command process's file mode creation mask
           umask = 0137
           # Command process audit ID
           auid = 'test'
           # Command process will run with this user / group credentials
           ids = {
                    ...
           }
           # Command process will run with these system capabilities(7)
           caps = [ "net_bind_service", "net_raw" ]
           # Command process's current working directory
           cwd = "/var/lib/mydaemon"
           # Leave these file descriptors opened
           keep_fds = [ 5, 8 ]
   }

umask-attr
**********

Within the context of a `top-proc`_ statement, specify the |umask| to run
the command process with.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**umask-attr**> ::= 'umask =' <|fs-mode|>

This attribute is optional and *defaults* to ``0077`` when unspecified.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::

   # Load system user and groups
   proc = {
           ...
           umask = 0022
           ...
   }

user-attr
*********

Assign specified user to the related parent object.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   <**user-attr**> ::= 'user =' <**user**>
   <**user**>      ::= <|uid|> | '"' <|username|> '"'

Within the context of a parent filesystem object, the `user-attr`_ statement
sets up owner permission bits of the related object.  See sections `jail-fsset`_
and `top-host`_ for more informations about concerned filesystem object types.

Within the context of a `top-ids`_ statement, `user-attr`_ specifies the user
to load |credentials| for.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 7,8

   # Define a loopback block device file
   {
           type  = "blkdev"
           # Pathname to block device file
           path  = "/dev/loop0"
           ...
           # Owner
           user = "root"
           ...
   }

OpenSSH server
--------------

.. _openssh: https://www.openssh.com

Requirements
************

This section details how to |jail| an OpenSSH_ server using the |Enbox tool|
according to the following requirements:

* run the `master sshd process`_ as *root* with the least privileges possible
* |chroot(8)|'ed within a restricted filesystem hierarchy
* and allowing final user to run an SSH shell session
* retrieved through a PAM_ handshake.

The final user shell session should be:

* running as final user,
* and |chroot(8)|'ed into user's home directory within a restricted filesystem
  hierarchy

OpenSSH_ runtime analysis shows that it basically requires the following
|capabilities| to operate:

* sys_chroot
* setuid
* setgid
* chown
* fowner
* kill

In addition, the SSH `server processes`_ section below shows that, in the case
of a multiuser server instance, the `master sshd process`_ should run as *root*
with all |capabilities| listed above enabled in its permitted, effective,
inheritable and ambient sets.

Once |fork(2)|'ed as *root* by the `master sshd process`_, the
`privileged monitor process`_ |execve(2)| ``/libexec/sshd-session``, which
requires all |capabilities| listed above to be enabled in its permitted,
effective, inheritable and ambient sets.

Once |fork(2)|\'ed as *root* by the `privileged monitor process`_, the
`preauthentication child`_  |execve(2)| ``/libexec/sshd-auth``, which
requires all |capabilities| listed above to be enabled in its permitted and
effective sets.
However, inheritable and ambient sets may safely be cleared just after first
call to |execve(2)| since `preauthentication child`_ does not perform
further calls to this syscall.

Once |fork(2)|\'ed as *root* by the `privileged monitor process`_, the
`postauthentication child`_ requires all |capabilities| listed below to be
enabled in its permitted and effective sets.
As it does perform no more calls to |execve(2)|, the inheritable and ambient
sets may immediatly be cleared since it does not require its later calls to
|execve(2)| to preserve |capabilities|.

Finally, thanks to the Debian's *systemd-socket-activation.patch*, we may
further restrict privileges granted to OpenSSH_ server by requesting Enbox_ to
pre-open the listening socket(s) and pass them to the `master sshd process`_ at
instantiation time.
In this case, the *net_bind_service* capability is not required. In addition,
the server may run in its own *net* |namepaces| so that it does not need to see
system network interfaces anymore.

Server processes
****************

Below is an extremely brief description of a final user shell session started
over ssh from a *server process architecture point of view only*.

* `Privilege Separated OpenSSH <http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html>`_

master sshd process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``/sbin/sshd``, the main daemon itself
* runs as *root*
* listens to incoming connections on main port(s)
* |fork(2)| `privileged monitor process`_ upon incoming connections.

privileged monitor process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* |fork(2)|\'ed as *root* by the `master sshd process`_ upon incoming connection
  request
* quickly |execve(2)| ``/libexec/sshd-session`` which...
* ... |fork(2)| the `preauthentication child`_ (see ``privsep_preauth()``)
* renames process name to ``[priv]``
* waits for `preauthentication child`_ completion
* performs PAM_ handshake
* |fork(2)| the `postauthentication child`_ (see ``privsep_postauth()``)
* waits for `postauthentication child`_ completion
* and exits.

preauthentication child
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* otherwise known as the *unprivileged networking* process
* |fork(2)|\'ed as *root* by the `privileged monitor process`_ to perform
  *preauthentication*
* quickly |execve(2)| ``/libexec/sshd-auth`` which...
* ... renames process name to ``[session-auth]``
* sandboxes itself (seccomp)
* |chroot(8)| itself into ``/var/empty``
* then changes to unprivileged ``sshd`` user
* renames process name to ``[net]``
* performs preauthentication exchanges with the `privileged monitor process`_
* then exits.

postauthentication child
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* otherwise known as the *unprivileged monitor* process
* |fork(2)|\'ed as *root* by the `privileged monitor process`_ to perform
  *postauthentication*
* creates and setup process session
* eventually |chroot(8)| into final user chroot directory (if configured)
* switches to final user
* starts user session (see ``do_authenticated()``)
* runs user session loop (see ``server_loop2()``) which may eventually:

  * allocates and setup PTYs
  * renames process name to ``[<user>@<pts>]``
  * |fork(2)| and |execve(2)| final user shell (see ``do_exec_pty()``)

* then, upon end of user session, finalize PAM_ logic
* and exits
